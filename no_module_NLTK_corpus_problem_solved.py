# When you use import nltk and get an error:

# "No module named NLTK.corpus"

# You could try doing following:
# Start your python.
 
# $ python
# >>>import nltk
# >>>nltk.download('all')

# it might take you awhile to complete the 'all' download.

# when the download is completed exit python.

# $ pip install --upgrade nltk

# that should help!
